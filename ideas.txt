->Show how we parsed the data
    -how data are ordered: One file per station, inside file ordered per date/hour
->algorithms to use
    -Decide which data are useful
    -We want to calculate average, median, max, min temperatures for each stations
    or grouping the stations that are close. To do that we precompute the results for various data range
    The results data should be small enough to be possible to mantain different result sets
    to compute them we can start by calculating the statistic result on the smallest data range and from
    this compute it for larger data ranges. (maybe there is a problem with the median)
->decide how to analyze them -> Still to dedice
->list the tools for the UI
    -Google maps
    -Heatmap -> reference to the javascript library
    -You can press on a single point in a map and see the textual data of that station
    -Possibility to change the data range and to change the heatmap with the interested statistic (min,max..)
